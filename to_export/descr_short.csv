"4305";" <p>Available in over 50 countries, and rated among the best air purifiers in the United States, Airfree products reduce microbiological contamination in the air naturally, without using chemicals or filters. Recommended by doctors and with no contraindications, they can be used anywhere.</p><p>Specially developed for smaller rooms, the T model offers the same air sterilisation efficiency as other Airfree® models, for rooms up to 16 m2. This unique and elegant design will not compromise essential space in any room.</p><p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p><p>Airfree’s exclusive technology works by eliminating microorganisms and allergens, destroying them in a fraction of a second. Depending on the model, between 14,000 and 20,000 litres of air pass through the Airfree device every hour, treating all the air in the room in a very short space of time.</p><p>The process works in much the same way as sterilising water by boiling it; when water is boiled, the microorganisms it contains are eliminated. In similar fashion, Airfree continually draws in air from the room, heating it to over 200 ºC and instantly sterilising it. The purified air is then cooled inside the device before being returned to the room.</p><p>The entire process is completely silent and requires no maintenance, not even the occasional replacement of parts. All you have to do is switch the device on and leave it to get on with the job.</p><p><strong>Airfree advantages</strong></p><ul><li>- Highly Effective</li><li>- Exclusive patented technology</li><li>- No maintenance</li><li>- Completely silent</li><li>- Low energy consumption</li><li>- Small and portable</li><li>- Clean, environmentally-friendly technology</li><li>- No ozone or ion emissions</li><li>- Award-winning design</li></ul><p><strong>Credibility</strong></p><p>Airfree technology has been tested and proven by dozens of laboratories worldwide.</p><p><strong>Technical Specifications</strong></p><ul><li>Capacity – 180 sq ft</li><li>Weight – 1.5 lb (0,7 Kg)</li><li>Energy Consumption – 33 watts</li><li>Size – width: 6.1 in (15.5 cm) x height: 12 in (30.5 cm) x depth: 3.5 in(9 cm)</li><li>Voltage – 110-127V</li><li>Thermistor safety sensors, thermal fuse, tilt sensor, varistor, current limiting fuse</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="style20" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Courier;" align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FF0010" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">No fan, no UV lights, no filters!&nbsp;</span></font></font></font></font></font></p><p class="style20" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Courier;" align="center"><img alt="" src="http://healthinfousa.com/ebaylisting/p1000e.jpg" height="208" width="434"></p><h2 class="style1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#5e005e">Airfree destroys mold spores, organic allergens, bacteria, viruses and other airborne microorganisms</font></b></font></h2><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium;"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#5e005e"><br></font></b></font></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</p><p class="style20" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Courier;" align="left"><font size="4"><a id="why" name="why"></a></font></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Courier;"><font size="4"><strong><img src="http://www.airfree.com/seta.jpg" height="10" width="15">&nbsp;</strong><strong class="style25"><span lang="EN-US">Why Airfree?</span></strong></font></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Courier;"><font size="4"><span class="style20"><strong><span lang="EN-US">1.

"4307";" <p>Available in over 50 countries, and rated among the best air purifiers in the United States, Airfree products reduce microbiological contamination in the air naturally, without using chemicals or filters. Recommended by doctors and with no contraindications, they can be used anywhere.</p><p>Specially developed for smaller rooms, the T model offers the same air sterilisation efficiency as other Airfree® models, for rooms up to 180 sq ft. This unique and elegant design will not compromise essential space in any room.</p><p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p><p>Airfree’s exclusive technology works by eliminating microorganisms and allergens, destroying them in a fraction of a second. Depending on the model, between 14,000 and 20,000 litres of air pass through the Airfree device every hour, treating all the air in the room in a very short space of time.</p><p>The process works in much the same way as sterilising water by boiling it; when water is boiled, the microorganisms it contains are eliminated. In similar fashion, Airfree continually draws in air from the room, heating it to over 200 ºC and instantly sterilising it. The purified air is then cooled inside the device before being returned to the room.</p><p>The entire process is completely silent and requires no maintenance, not even the occasional replacement of parts. All you have to do is switch the device on and leave it to get on with the job.</p><p><strong>Airfree advantages</strong></p><ul><li>- Highly Effective</li><li>- Exclusive patented technology</li><li>- No maintenance</li><li>- Completely silent</li><li>- Low energy consumption</li><li>- Small and portable</li><li>- Clean, environmentally-friendly technology</li><li>- No ozone or ion emissions</li><li>- Award-winning design</li></ul><p><strong>Credibility</strong></p><p>Airfree technology has been tested and proven by dozens of laboratories worldwide.</p><p><strong>Technical Specifications</strong></p><ul><li>Capacity – 180 sq ft</li><li>Weight – 1.5 lb (0,7 Kg)</li><li>Energy Consumption – 33 watts</li><li>Size – diameter: 5.1 in (13 cm) x height: 11.8 in (30 cm)</li><li>Voltage – 110-127V</li><li>Thermistor safety sensors, thermal fuse, tilt sensor, varistor, current limiting fuse</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p class="style20" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Courier;" align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FF0010" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">No fan, no UV lights, no filters!&nbsp;</span></font></font></font></font></font></p><p class="style20" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Courier;" align="center"><img alt="" src="http://healthinfousa.com/ebaylisting/p1000e.jpg" height="208" width="434"></p><h2 class="style1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#5e005e">Airfree destroys mold spores, organic allergens, bacteria, viruses and other airborne microorganisms</font></b></font></h2><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium;"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#5e005e"><br></font></b></font></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</p><p class="style20" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Courier;" align="left"><font size="4"><a id="why" name="why"></a></font></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Courier;"><font size="4"><strong><img src="http://www.airfree.com/seta.jpg" height="10" width="15">&nbsp;</strong><strong class="style25"><span lang="EN-US">Why Airfree?</span></strong></font></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Courier;"><font size="4"><span class="style20"><strong><span lang="EN-US">1.

Plastics, particularly when they begin to warm, can off gas and cause problems for the chemically sensitive. That's why Austin Air cleaners have all steel construction with a baked on powder coat finish. The sturdy steel construction of every Austin Air product guarantees that your air cleaner will last for years. Air is drawn through two particle pre-filters with a powerful 1.5 h.p. PSC motor then through a 15 lb. bed of blended activated carbon, 60 sq. ft. of true HEPA filter media, and finally through a HEGA carbon cloth. This five stage process provides the best air filtration of any Austin air purifier available.

Airfree reduces Ozone whereas ozone generators generate dangerous levels of such harmful gas that destroys lung tissue, triggers respiratory diseases, and corrodes metallic equipment.</span></span></p><ul><li><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Capacity: 650 sq. ft</span></span></li><li><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Electric consumption: 52W</span></span></li><li><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Voltage: 110 - 127V</span></span></li><li><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Dimensions: height 10.4 in (26.5 cm) and diameter 8.4 in (21.5) cm</span></span></li><li><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Noise level: Completely silent.</span></span></li><li><span style="color:#000080;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Weight: 3.3 lbs (1.48KG)</span></span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://healthinfousa.com/ebaylisting/p1000f.jpg" height="117" width="200"></p><p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p><p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium;" align="center"><b><font size="5">Airfree Onix 3000&nbsp;</font><br></b></div><p class="style20" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Courier;" align="center">&nbsp;</p><p class="style20" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Courier;" align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font color="#FF0010" size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="4"><span style="font-weight: bold;">No fan, no UV lights, no filters!&nbsp;</span></font></font></font></font></font></p><p class="style20" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Courier;" align="center"><img alt="" src="http://healthinfousa.com/ebaylisting/p1000e.jpg" height="208" width="434"></p><h2 class="style1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;" align="center"><font size="4" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#5e005e">Airfree destroys mold spores, organic allergens, bacteria, viruses and other airborne microorganisms</font></b></font></h2><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium;"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><font color="#5e005e"><br></font></b></font></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</p><p class="style20" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Courier;" align="left"><font size="4"><a id="why" name="why"></a></font></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Courier;"><font size="4"><strong><img src="http://www.airfree.com/seta.jpg" height="10" width="15">&nbsp;</strong><strong class="style25"><span lang="EN-US">Why Airfree?</span></strong></font></p><p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: medium; font-family: Courier;"><font size="4"><span class="style20"><strong><span lang="EN-US">1.
